# 2mp3       

convert your media files into mp3 files.


# Usage

$ `python core.py '/directory/with/files/to/convert'`        
by default 2mp3 doesn't remove the original file after conversion. If you want to remove/delete original files after conversion, passing in the -r option. ie,          
$ `python core.py '/directory/with/files/to/convert' -r`  


# todo
* add ability to pass in a file to convert rather than a directory of files to convert
